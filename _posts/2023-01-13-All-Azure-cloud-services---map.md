Azure has a nice website with all the services that it offers. You can find
it here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/?cdn=disable.

I've created a visual map of all of them. And as of today (2023-01-13)
there are 211 services in 21 categories. There are a lot of services.

Some services might have more than one category.

The map is located here: https://www.pawelkowalik.com/maps/azure-services/

There are 2 versions: collapsed and expanded (without or with the
description).

I hope you'll enjoy it.
