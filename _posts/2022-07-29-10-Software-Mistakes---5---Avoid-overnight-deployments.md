> People do more mistakes working at night

# Problem
When a new feature has to start working on a given day, you have to pay for
night duties to deploy it after working hours.

# Solution
Just use Feature Toggles and enable them on specific time **automatically**.

# Benefit
You could deploy disabled code at **any time** and enable it at any
convenient moment with no additional costs and you can go **back and
forth**.
