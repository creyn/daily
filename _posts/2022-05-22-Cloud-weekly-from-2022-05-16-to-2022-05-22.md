Welcome to the **Cloud weekly** issue no 2. The weekly notes I've taken
around the Azure environment.

# This week in Azure
This was more of a quiet week for Azure updates. The most updated service
was [[Azure Kubernetes Service]] which got new updates both generally
available and in preview.

Microsoft Build 2022 (May 24-26, 2022) is coming. Register now. [MS Build

# Money tips
Remember to set up tags, budgets and alerts for your Azure costs.

The Azure cost is not only **compute** and **storage**, but also
**security** (firewalls, [[Azure Bastion]]), **backup**, **DR** and
**network** (including **bandwidth**). The network part is really important
and you should put a lot of attention to your architecture. Probably you
can see that the data sizing is very important and online calculators
cannot provide you the costs for your bandwidth.
