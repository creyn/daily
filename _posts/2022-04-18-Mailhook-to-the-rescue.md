The Integromat tool has a very nice trigger option called "Mailhook". This
is basically a dedicated email address on the Integromat servers that I can
send email to and trigger a workflow.

It is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it is hidden in the
"Webhooks" section, and I missed it till now.

So if you are looking for a **free** integration between "email address"
and "GitHub new file creation", you should use the **Mailhook from
Integromat**.
