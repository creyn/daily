Welcome to the **Cloud weekly** issue no 4. The weekly notes I've taken
around the Azure environment.

# This week in Azure
Last week was quite busy because of the MS Build 2022 and this one we are
resting a little bit. But still some interesting news.

The **action group** availability in [[Azure Cost Management and Billing]]
allows for better notifications and automations on budget consumption. This
enables interesting options for **cost optimization**.

New benchmarks prove that [[Azure SQL Managed Instance ðŸ’²]] leads in
price-performance for mission-critical workloads. Which is not exactly
accurate to my knowledge. You know, benchmarks.
