By working for 15+ years for different clients I found that there are
common mistakes in the design of the software and the development process
that could slow down implementation of new features.

This is especially visible in the areas regulated by the government, where
**the time pressure is big and requirements are not so clear**.

I collected 10 mistakes and proposed 10 ways to avoid them, in order for
you to implement new features **faster and easier**. I really hope this
will be a benefit for you.

I will send them in the next 10 days so you could think about it a
little bit.
