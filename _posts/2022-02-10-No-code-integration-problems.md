I am trying to create my daily email pipeline using free no code integration solutions. I couldn't do it.


My desired process:
1. Write an email
2. Send it to the "daily email" address
3. Create Zapier (?) integration : from Gmail to GitHub
4. Run GitHub actions to build a daily email website (automatic)


And the GitHub integration on Zapier cannot push files to GitHub. Really. Something so simple (and basic) is not supported. It can be done by the HTTP API integration, but it is a premium feature. So it breaks my assumption that the pipeline has to be free.


So I checked the Azure Logic App connectors. It also failed. No GitHub file push integration. There is a HTTP API integration, but it cannot be used when the Gmail connector is used (sic!).


Something very strange is going on with those no-code solutions. It is like "we are almost there and yes, you can build some staff but only what we allow you to build". It kind of makes sense. But I expected something more in 2022.


So now this daily email is done by manual process. I will be thinking how to do the pipeline for free and with no-code. But I am afraid I will have to pay or write some code eventually. We'll see.
