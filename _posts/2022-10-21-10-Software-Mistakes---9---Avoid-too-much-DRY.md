> Simple is better than over engineered

# Problem
When government regulations have to be implemented, they could accidently
force regression testing in not related departments.

# Solution
Just **don’t** use DRY too much.

# Benefit
You will be able to safely introduce changes **only for those departments
that really need them**. Other departments don’t need to know about any
changes.
