Hi there,

If we want to discuss testing applications designed and created by AI we
have to understand why do we test applications created by developers?

Don't we trust developers?

Don't developers trust themselves?

No. We do test our applicatios for several other reasons. Not because of
trust. I will discuss them soon.

So even if we will trust AI we still will want to test applications it
creates.
