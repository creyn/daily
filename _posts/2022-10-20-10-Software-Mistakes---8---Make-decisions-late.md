> You can start development without the details

# Problem
When government regulations have to be implemented, the details could be
not known upfront and this blocks the development.

# Solution
Just use **Clean Architecture** and postpone decisions as long as possible.

# Benefit
You will be able to **start development** right away and implement storage
and UI when you have the most knowledge available.
