One of the key architecture drivers is money. It impacts almost all of the
decisions you have to make as an architect. It is often the case that even
if there is a better solution techwise, it is more expensive and the
cheaper alternative is good enough.


Like in my email pipeline. I had two architectural drivers:
- it had to be only about sending email, no website, no other actions from
my side, frictionless solution that enables me to open an email app, type
the email and press send
- no more money from my side, I didn't want to pay more that I am already
paying for staff, so I was able to accept Azure services (to the free
limits I have) but I didn't wanted to buy Zapier premium (free integrations
wasn't enough)


So this is why my solution looks the way it is. Could I do it better? Yes.
Could I use better tech? Yes.


But money is always a key architectural driver. Even for such small pet
projects like this one.
