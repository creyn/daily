Do you have architecture if you don't have an architect in your company?

Yes, you have.

Architecture is how you build the company and your systems. All the
decisions you make.

So if you don't have an architect, make sure you are documenting those
decisions. With the context around them, different options you've
considered constraints, and assumptions.

You will thank me later. When you need to change a decision in the future.

You can read more about ADR or Architecture Decision Record.
