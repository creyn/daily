title: Starting daily

I was hoping to get into daily email sending for too long now. And today's inspiration from Jonathan is a trigger, a mark. I am starting today. What I will be writing about? I don't know. Tech, architecture, whiskey, well beeing, coding, crypto, life. I don't know. We will see. Whatever the inspiration will be. So here I am. Welcome friends.
