I did a little experiment. I wanted to see how difficult it would be to
write a book (and publish it) with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).

There are tons of AI tools available online in the beginning of 2023.
Basically I needed two things: writing a book (text) and illustrating it
(images).

For text, I've used the (Chat GPT from OpenAI)[https://chat.openai.com/].

For images, I've used the (Midjourney)[https://www.midjourney.com/]. And
(Canva)[https://www.canva.com/] which I've also used for editing the final
PDF.

And for publishing, I've used the (KDP from Amazon)[https://kdp.amazon.com/
].

Those are not free for commercial use, but not so expensive either.

And voila! There it is: (Instai kitty solves inflation)[
https://www.amazon.com/Instai-kitty-solves-inflation-Children/dp/B0BSJ9XM8B/
].

I am expecting the delivery tomorrow, and I will write some updates about
the quality of the book.

I think that this is awesome. I could **focus on delivering value** to
readers without worrying about illustrations and publishing. The whole
process took me just about 2 days. Very value driven. I think AI and
publishing automation will be the future of physical books.
