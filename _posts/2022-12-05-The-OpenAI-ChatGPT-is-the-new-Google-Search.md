The new publicly available chat based on the OpenAI GPT language model is a
real deal breaker.

But not how everybody thinks about it. Yes, it will replace some jobs, will
make some jobs easier and open a lot of new cool possibilities.

But the real competitor that should be afraid right now is **Google
Search** engine.

Playing with the chat reminds me of the very early days of Google Search,
when you actually could find what you are looking for. Without ads, black
SEO and all the copy paste noise that Google Search serves us today.

The GPT model is trained on data up to 2021, so some knowledge might be
obsolete, but still it is a fantastic tool.

So please try it. The next time you need to google something, go to the
ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/chat.
