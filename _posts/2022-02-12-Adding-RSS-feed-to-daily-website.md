Next step on my "daily email list" was to add the RSS feed on the website.
This will enable a lot of integrations to my daily emails.


So now I have [RSS feed](https://creyn.github.io/daily/feed.xml). I was
able to subscribe to this feed in my Thunderbird client.


I used this great and simple tutorial by Dzhavat Ushev : [Adding an RSS
feed to GitHub Pages](

)
