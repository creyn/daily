There are times that you are trying new things. Playing with them a little
bit, just to see what they are. Or maybe to consider them as the new "main
thing". But often, they are a little bit off, they miss something or change
something that you know from your main thing. So at the end of the day you
came back to the good old "known". The thing that you know like the back of
your hand.

That is a gread architectural driver, isn't it?

For me the current "known" is the Wordpress platform. I did try all those
new things for hosting blogs and personal websites. But all of them lack
something that I know from the Wordpress platform. So here I am,
choosing the good old known Wordpress for my website.

I hope you will enjoy it: [Paweł Kowalik](https://www.pawelkowalik.com/)
