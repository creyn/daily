> Manual testing takes time and is a risk of human errors

# Problem
When doing manual testing, it takes a long time and one could make a
mistake or forget about
something

# Solution.
Just use Test Driven Development or Test First with a *full suite of
automated tests*.

# Benefit
You will be sure that the application works properly in a *much faster* UAT
phase.
