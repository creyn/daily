> Feature branches make developers take days to merge to main branch

# Problem
When developing a long-lasting project in feature branches, merging into
the main application could take a day or two to resolve all conflicts.

# Solution
Just use Continuous Integration and **merge daily** to the main branch.

# Benefit
You will resolve smaller conflicts **easier and faster** and the new code
could be hidden behind the Feature Toggle.
