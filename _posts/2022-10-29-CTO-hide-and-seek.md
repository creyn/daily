Every CTO that I've worked with wanted one thing: visibility. For costs,
technology, road maps, progress, you name it. But at the same time
companies struggled to deliver that. The overall visibility for, you know,
everything.

It works both ways though. The business wants to know dev progress. But
devs also want to know strategy. It has to be beneficial for everybody.

This is where a good architect will help you. He will work to unhide stuff,
to make it easy too look around, see and understand.
