ADR or Architecture Decision Record is a log entry about the decision you
are making.

Why do this? Because everything changes and you will have to change some
decisions. And if you don't know or remember the reasoning behind the
initial decision it is difficult to change it with confidence.

And if you change a decision, don't delete the previous ADR. Create a new
one and link them together. Make it very visible to readers of both the old
and the new ADR.
