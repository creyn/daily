Microsoft enables everybody to use OpenAI services on Azure. Currently
those are: GPT3.5, Codex and DALEE2 with the ChatGPT coming soon.

Looking at prices, the base options are the same using OpenAI directly or
by using Azure.

For the fine-tuned models there is also a cost of hosting and training
(training is charged by hours not tokens as in OpenAI).

Regarding data sovereignty, you can choose a few regions: Central US, East
US, South Central US, West US 2 and **West Europe**. I'm sure more regions
will follow.

Definitely worth checking out.
