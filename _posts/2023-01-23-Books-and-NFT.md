My little experiment with writing a book with the help of AI was
successful.  Today I received my book. Awesome feeling ðŸ˜Ž

And the print quality from Amazon KDP is really nice.

This makes me think about an idea I had last year, how to connect an NFT
(Non-Fungible Token) with a physical book.

I was thinking about printing a different QR code inside each book. This
code would have a link to its own NFT.

And I think it could be possible, we only need a dynamic content for each
book. Or an API that could update content on each sell.

I have to do a little research but maybe there is something there.

Either way, I really recommend you to publish your own book. Maybe with the
help of AI ðŸ˜‰
