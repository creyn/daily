A successful business solves problems for its customers. This is the main
idea behind any  profitable business: to make money by solving problems for
customer satisfaction.

And the best way to know those problems is to talk to your customers.
Direct conversation can give you the most value. But it does not scale
well. For that, the online surveys are the best option.

There are many online survey tools. You can easily find one. But the one
that I really like is [Tally](https://tally.so/). The free version is more
than enough to create nice forms with many integrations for surveying your
customers.

Let's try it. Can I ask you **what would you like to read about in my
daily emails**? I would be delighted to help you solve your problem.

Here is the link to the form: https://tally.so/r/nWOppe
