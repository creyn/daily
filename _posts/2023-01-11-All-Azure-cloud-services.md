Every cloud provider has a lot of different services. Like storage, virtual
machines, containers, security, identity or compute.

For Azure you can find all of them here:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/

Grouped by category, with search option and links to details. Keep in mind
that some services are in multiple categories. **Azure Container
Instances** service is in both: **Compute** and **Containers**.

Please take a look at the **Artifical Intelligence + Machine Learning**
group. Azure has many services in that space.
