From the recent [Microsoft Annual Report for 2022](
https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar22/index.html) we can learn
that **cloud** is the main revenue source for the company.

This comes as no surprise as we see companies migrating to the cloud and
moving away from owning and managing their own data centers.

From the report:
Revenue, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as
follows:
(in millions)
- Server products and cloud services - $67,321 (+28% Y/Y)
- Office products and cloud services - $44,862 (+13%)
- Windows - $24,761 (+10%)
- Gaming - $16,230 (+6%)
- LinkedIn - $13,816 (+34%)
- Search and news advertising - $11,591 (+25%)
- Enterprise Services - $7,407 (7%)
- Devices - 6,991 (+3%)
- Other - 5,291 (+18%)

So as you can see, Microsoft is not an operating system company, it is a
cloud provider. And it will be in the future for sure.
