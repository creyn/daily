In the previous email I wrote that both Zapier and Azure Logic App were no
good for my automated daily email pipeline.

Next one was Integromat. And it worked. Kind of. The Gmail connector can be
run every 15 minutes, so it is not as real time as I thought. But it might
be enough for now. The GitHub integration is more feature rich than in
Zapier. It can push files to the repository.

Integromat has a very nice step by step tutorial on how to set up the OAuth
integration for private Gmail accounts (
https://www.integromat.com/en/help/connecting-integromat-to-google-services-using-a-custom-oauth-client).
I've missed this both in Zapier and Azure Logic App. Integrator has better
user experience so I will give it a try.

# Will it work?

Will this email appear on the website in 15 minutes? It is 08:40 now.
