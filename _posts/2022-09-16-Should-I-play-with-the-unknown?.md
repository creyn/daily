I wrote about going back to the "known". The thing that you know as the
back of your hand. It is safe and proven and it simply works. But it
doesn't mean you shouldn't play with the unknown.

New solutions and products can offer better things that we know currently.
They are opportunities to do things differently. They could be
better, faster and more efficient.

So yes, please play with the "unknown" for some time. Allocate time and
resources and have an open mind. This might pay off.

You can always go back to the good old "known" later.
