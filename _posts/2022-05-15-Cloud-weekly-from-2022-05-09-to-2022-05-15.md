Welcome to the **Cloud weekly** issue no 1. The weekly notes I've taken
around the Azure environment.

## This week in Azure

[[Azure Static Web Apps]] is 1 years old. Time flies. It has already been a
year. You can use it for hosting SPAs with the serverless backend.
Definitely something to try.

I am very excited about the [[Azure Text to speech]] update and all those
new voices and **emotions**. I can imagine new content readers and game
characters to be fully automated now.

Nice article about [[Azure Health Data Services]] and IoMT (Internet of
Medical Things) how to fight the diabetic foot problem and monitor patients
remotely with the proper security for the [[Protected Health Information -
PHI]] data.

Exciting times.

Microsoft Build 2022 is coming. Register now. [MS Build website](

# Money tips
Remember to set up tags, budgets and alerts for your Azure costs.

Tip: You can run [[Azure SQL]] in a DTU or serverless model to cut the
prices (really good for non-production environments).

# Available:
[[Azure IoT Edge]]:
- **Debian Bullseye** is officially a "Tier 1" system (supported by
Microsoft). "Tier 2" systems are considered compatible with [[Azure IoT
Edge]] but not actively tested or maintained by Microsoft.

[[Azure SQL]]:
- The [[Azure SQL Database]] **Hyperscale** has now 99.99% SLA (change from
99.95% and 99.90%)
- The [[Azure Database for MySQL]] **Flexible Server** is now running on
the latest MySQL minor versions 8.0.28 and 5.7.37.

[[Azure Arc]]:
- [[Azure Private Link]] : using **site-to-site VPN** or **[[Azure
ExpressRoute]]** you can connect the on-prem network to the Azure portal
and not send traffic over the public internet.

[[Azure Monitor]]:
- [[Secure webhook]] is now available for connecting to [[ðŸ’Ž IT Service
Management - ITSM]] tools. It is more preferable because of the [[Azure
Active Directory (Azure AD)]] integration.

[[Azure Cognitive Services]]:
- Computer Vision character recognition (OCR) supports 164 languages (both
cloud and Docker version)

[[Azure Data Lake Storage]]:
- Simplified experience in the portal to migrate from [[Azure Data Lake
Storage Gen1]] to [[Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2]] (as the Gen1 will be
retired in 2024)

[[Azure Virtual Machines]]:
- The [[Trusted launch]] Gen2 VMs secure images are available in [[Azure
Compute Gallery]]

# Preview:
[[Azure Virtual Machines]]:
- The **DCsv3-series** virtual machines are available in Australia East,
Japan East, South Central US and Southeast Asia. Both DCsv3 and DCdsv3 help
protect the confidentiality and integrity of the code and data on the
public cloud. Part of [[Azure confidential computing]]

[[Azure Container Apps]]:
- Two new options: see log stream and connect to a running container
console.

[[Azure Static Web Apps]]:
- For speed up the build process you can skip building of the API
- The [[Azure DevOps]] integration is supported via the portal
