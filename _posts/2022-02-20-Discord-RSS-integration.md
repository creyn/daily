It looks like Discord doesn't have a built-in RSS integration. But there is
a bot that everybody uses and recommends: [MonitoRSS](https://monitorss.xyz/).
The setup is very easy and it has some nice configuration options.


Let's test it. This is the very first email that will (should) appear in
the `#daily-emails` channel in my Discord server.
