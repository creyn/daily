> You are not Amazon and probably don't need microservices

# Problem
When new requirements have to be implemented, you waste time on redesigning
the application with the wrong architecture. If you use microservices
because of hype then you are doomed.

# Solution
Just use the **modular monolith** architecture.

# Benefit
You could **redesign the code faster** without worrying about network and
communication issues. All your modules should be aligned with business.
