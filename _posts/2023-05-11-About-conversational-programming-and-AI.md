Hi there,

Can AI make developers obsolete? It can already write code so we actually
don't need developers. Right?

Not exactly. Because programming is not only about code, but also about the
design. And right now AI cannot discuss problems with business people and
guide them and discover the solution.

But this will change. Imagine having a proper design session with AI. A
conversation that leads to the proper solution. With voice to voice,
whiteboard drawings and deep understanding of the environment.

This is where things will be more interesting.

Pay attention to conversational programming advantages.
