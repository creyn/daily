The RSS integration in Slack added. There is an RSS plugin where you put
the URL of the RSS XML feed and that's it. Quite simple implementation. But
it does not fetch all current entries from the feed (or even last 10
entries).


So this will be the very first email that should appear on the
`#daily-emails` Slack channel. I hope so :)
