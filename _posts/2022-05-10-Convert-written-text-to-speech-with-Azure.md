Azure has a cool service called **Text to Speech**. Basically it turns
written text into speech. For example you could build a voice bot, a
content reader or a personal assistant. But the most interesting part is a
game character that normally would require a human actor to record all of
the conversations. It is a **big cost saver**.

Especially for the US-English you can use male or female voices and choose
different emotions (like anger or excitement). There is even a whispering
option. This is so cool.
