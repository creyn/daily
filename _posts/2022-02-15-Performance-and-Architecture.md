Is performance an architectural driver? Yes it is. A very important one.
For some systems. Most of them. For few it is a factor but not very
important. Take my daily email pipeline. The integration runs every 15
minutes. But that is OK for me. Would I like a real time integration? Of
course. But other drivers were more important. So as always, "it depends".
