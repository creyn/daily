There are different kinds of IT architects.


There are:
- business architects
- enterprise architects
- solution architects
- technical architects (like .Net or Java architects)
- integration architects
- data architects


To name a few. The problem is: how to find boundaries between them? If your
company is small you probably need just one architect. But which one? What
are the responsibilities of each?


It is not so easy.


And why we even have so many specialities inside the IT architects? Are
those concepts and knowledge domains so difficult? I would say: no.
