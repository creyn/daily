Imagine two kids: Alice and Bob. They both get a present from their
parents: a balloon. Alice gets a red one. Bob gets a blue one.

Parents notice that both children are sad.

P: Alice, why are you sad?
A: I don't like red colors ðŸ˜¥

P: Bob, why are you sad?
B: I want the red balloon ðŸ˜¥

P: Do you want to swap?
YES

And now everybody is happy ðŸ˜Š

The reason is that they all value different things:
- Alice values the blue balloon more
- Bob values the red balloon more
- Parents values children's happiness (they don't care who has which color)

The moral is that: **you don't know what other people value unless you ask
them**.

This also works for the IT projects ðŸ˜Ž
