When designing architecture and creating documentation, an architect needs
icons. Icons about infrastructure, services, networking, security, storage,
etc. And specific to a given technology. Ideally from the vendor itself.

Microsoft provides a set of icons for Azure and recently (January 2023)
they've added new icons.

You can find them all here: [Azure architecture icons](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/).

There are 506 icons. I've put them in one image to see how many services
Azure offers. It is on the updated [Azure services](
https://www.pawelkowalik.com/maps/azure-services/) page.
