There are so many job titles for architect:
- technical
- domain
- solution
- application
- data
- integration
- **cloud**

Recently I am highly focused on the New Space domain. Not only is it
interesting but also quite impressive. Especially with SpaceX and the lower
and lower cargo costs for bringing satellites into space.

And Azure as well has some space tech. This is a very nice blog post about
[Azure Orbital](
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/any-developer-can-be-a-space-developer-with-the-new-azure-orbital-space-sdk/
).

So is the **Space Architect** the next big thing? I definitely will pursue
this.
