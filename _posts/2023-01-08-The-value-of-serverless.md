By serverless we understand a hosting option for our software that does not
require us to maintain our own servers.

And that is the biggest value of serverless. Because if you have your own
servers you have to pay for them and maintain them daily (which also costs).

On the other hand, with serverless you have less control of the servers and
the hosting options.

So you have to ask yourself a question: do you need more control? My take
is that it depends, but in most cases, you should care more about the
business outcome of your software. So you should focus on what it does, and
not where it runs.

So, choose serverless.
